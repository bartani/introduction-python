# introduction-python
In this project, we will learn the basic source code of Python for further training in machine learning and deep learning.

Hi guys

To learned machine learning or deep learning, you must first become familiar with Python source codes and libraries such as Numpy, matplotlib and ect.
For this reason, at here we have tried to put the codes needed for these tutorials.


Thanks
